                Welcome to the University of Nairobi Online Application System
                

                Registration
                

                Before you can start to make an application you must first of all register or create a user account for yourself. Upon completion, an email will be sent to you (email provided during registration) requiring you to activate your account together with your username and password.  This will allow you to log into your account to manage your profile and track the progress of your application. To create your account please click on the Register button otherwise enter your username and password to log in to your account.
                

                Please note that every applicant must create their own personal account, including applicants who apply with the assistance of an agent.
                

                Profile Management
                

                To apply for a university programme you will be required to complete your profile. These include your personal details, contact information, education background, work experience and Referees. You will also be required to upload scanned copies of your certificates, transcripts and passport photo. If you do not manage to complete your profile in one session your data will be saved and you can still come back and complete it at a later time.
                

                Programme Selection
                

                Only when your profile is complete can you apply for the programme you wish to undertake. You will select your programme from the intakes that are open at the time of making the application. You will also be able to view the entry requirements for the programme to see if you meet the requirements before making the application.
                

                Payment of Application Fees
                

                If satisfied and wish to proceed you will be directed to the payment section where you pay the application fees. The system supports online payment using Master and Visa cards, Mpesa and payment through the bank. In each case the system will issue an applicant reference number which should be used as the account no when making the payment.
                

                Application Tracking

                You will be able to track the status of your application online through the system.
                

                Admission/Registration Process

The Online application system provides a mechanism for applicants to track the progress of the admission process at any given time. Upon the conclusion of the admission process, the applicant can download the admission letter and the joining instructions. 
To accept admission, the applicant will need to pay KES 60,000.00 the minimum fees requirements using the reference number.
Upon payment of the minimum fees, the applicant will log in to the student portal UON Student Portal and generate a registration number thereby becoming an unregistered student. The applicant will also attain credentials for the student portal 
User name (Registration Number), Password (National ID number or Passport number). Using this credentials the student should log in to the portal and complete registration by submitting all the requisite documents online using the student registration link. Your student status is complete after the student registration process is complete and from there on, you can engage university activities as a fully registered student.
